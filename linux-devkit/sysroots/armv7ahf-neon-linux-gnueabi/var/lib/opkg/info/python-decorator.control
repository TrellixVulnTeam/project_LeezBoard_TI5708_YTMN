Package: python-decorator
Version: 4.0.10-r0.0
Description: Python decorator utilities
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators
 for the average programmer, and to popularize decorators by showing
 various non-trivial examples. Of course, as all techniques, decorators
 can be abused and you should not try to solve every problem with a
 decorator, just because you can.
