Package: libcairo-dev
Version: 1.14.6-r0.0
Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library - Development files
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased vector-based
 rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist of line segments
 and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width with various join and
 cap styles. All colors may be specified with optional translucence
 (opacity/alpha) and combined using the extended Porter/Duff compositing
 algebra as found in the X Render Extension.  This package contains
 symbolic links, header files, and related items necessary for software
 development.
