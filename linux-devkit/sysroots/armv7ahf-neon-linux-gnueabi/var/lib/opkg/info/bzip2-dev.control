Package: bzip2-dev
Version: 1.0.6-r5.0
Description: Very high-quality data compression program - Development files
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.  This package contains symbolic links,
 header files, and related items necessary for software development.
