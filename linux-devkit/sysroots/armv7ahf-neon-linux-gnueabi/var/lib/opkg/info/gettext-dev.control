Package: gettext-dev
Version: 0.16.1-r6.0
Description: Utilities and libraries for producing multi-lingual messages - Development files
 GNU gettext is a set of tools that provides a framework to help other
 programs produce multi-lingual messages. These tools include a set of
 conventions about how programs should be written to support message
 catalogs, a directory and file naming organization for the message
 catalogs themselves, a runtime library supporting the retrieval of
 translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs to massage in various
 ways the sets of translatable and already translated strings.  This
 package contains symbolic links, header files, and related items
 necessary for software development.
