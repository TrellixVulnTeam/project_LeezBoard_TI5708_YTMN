/*
 *     This function is used to fill an array with Gaussian normal distributed
 *     random numbers.These numbers are distributed assuming mean (mu) = 0 and
 *     standard deviation (sigma) = 1.
 *
 *     The output vector can be modified for an arbitrary mu and sigma by
 *     adding its contents by the desired value of mu and multiplying its
 *     contents by the desired value of sigma respectively.
 *
 *          @param size = The size of the array to be filled.
 *
 *          @param vector = The array of type @b float which the user wants to
 *          fill with random values.
 *
 *          @param state = The array which was initialized with the
 *          "DSP_urand32_init" function and maintained (but NEVER modified) by
 *          the user between subsequent calls to this function.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * The RNG utilizes the Tiny Mersene Twister (TinyMT) as its underlying RNG
 * and George Marsaglia's Ziggurat algorithm as a wrapper RNG to generate a
 * Gaussian normal distribution from the uniformly distributed TinyMT.
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     The user has previously called the "DSP_urand32_init"
 *     function at least once, has maintained the state array, and allocated
 *     an array of @b float types of the desired width.
 *
 * @par Implementation notes:
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR>
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is not interruptible. <BR>
