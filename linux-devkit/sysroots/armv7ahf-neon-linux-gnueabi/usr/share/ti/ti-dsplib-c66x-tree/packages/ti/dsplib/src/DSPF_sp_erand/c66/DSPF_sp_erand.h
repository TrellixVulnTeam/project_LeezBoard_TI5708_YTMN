/**
 *     This function is used to fill an array with exponentially distributed
 *     random numbers.These numbers are distributed assuming a rate
 *     parameter (lambda) = 1;
 *
 *     The output vector can be modified for an arbitrary lambda by
 *     dividing its contents by the desired value of lambda (or, preferably
 *     for speed, multiplying its contents by the precomputed value of
 *     1/lambda) as shown in the histogram below.
 *
 *          @param size = The size of the array to be filled.
 *
 *          @param vector = The array which the user wants to fill with random
 *          values. Again, it should be of type @b float.
 *
 *          @param state = The array which was initialized with the
 *          "DSP_urand32_init" function and maintained (but NEVER modified) by
 *          the user between subsequent calls to this function.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * The RNG utilizes the Tiny Mersene Twister (TinyMT) as its underlying RNG
 * and an optimized version of George Marsaglia's Ziggurat algorithm as a
 * wrapper RNG to generate an exponential distribution from the uniformly
 * distributed TinyMT.
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     The user has previously called the "DSP_urand32_init"
 *     function at least once, has maintained the state array, and allocated
 *     an array of @b float types of the desired width.
 *
 * @par Implementation notes:
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR>
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is not interruptible. <BR>
