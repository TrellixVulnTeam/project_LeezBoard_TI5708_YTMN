/**
 *     This program stores 16-bit fixed-point random values in
 *     the provided vector.
 *
 *          @param seed = Pointer to an arbitrary seed (number) of
 *          type @b unsigned @b short.
 *
 *          @param size = The size of the vector to be filled with
 *          random values.
 *
 *          @param vector = The vector to be filled with random values.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 *  A linear congruential 16-bit random number generator is used.
 *  The equation is as follows <BR><BR>
 *  seed = (seed * 46341 + 1) % 65536 <BR><BR>
 *  See Numerical Recipes in C
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     The size of the vector to be filled is at least 16 and a multiple of 2 <BR>
 *     For optimal randomness, it is best that the user not seed the RNG with
 *     a value of zero.
 * @par Implementation notes:
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR>
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is not interruptible. <BR>
