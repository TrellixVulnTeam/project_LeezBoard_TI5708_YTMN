	tomp_cacheWbInvAll()
	CACHE_invAllL2()
	CACHE_wbInvAllL1d()
	tomp_waitAtBarrier()

Function CACHE_invAllL2() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] wait == 0u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_invAllL2() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned wait :     wait == 0u;

Function CACHE_wbInvAllL1d() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] wait == 0u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_wbInvAllL1d() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned wait :     wait == 0u;
