    It appears to be inlineable (size = 19 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:

extern void ti_runtime_ompbios_HeapOMP_getStats__E() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 1 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern unsigned short ti_runtime_ompbios_HeapOMP_isBlocking__E() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 2 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.

	<NONE>


These functions may be recursive:
	ti_runtime_ompbios_HeapOMP_alloc__E()
	ti_runtime_ompbios_HeapOMP_free__E()
	HeapOMP_getHeapFromAddr()

Making this function inlineable: HeapOMP_getHeapFromAddr()
Inlineable function will be suppressed: HeapOMP_getHeapFromAddr()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	xdc_runtime_Memory_free__E()
	ti_runtime_ompbios_OpenMP_useSharedHeap__E()
	xdc_runtime_Memory_alloc__E()
	SharedRegion_getId()
	SharedRegion_getHeap()
