Function CACHE_setL2Size() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] newSize == 3u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_setL2Size() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned newSize :  newSize == 3u;

Function CACHE_setL1PSize() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] newSize == 4u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_setL1PSize() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned newSize :  newSize == 4u;

Function CACHE_setL1DSize() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] newSize == 4u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_setL1DSize() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned newSize :  newSize == 4u;
