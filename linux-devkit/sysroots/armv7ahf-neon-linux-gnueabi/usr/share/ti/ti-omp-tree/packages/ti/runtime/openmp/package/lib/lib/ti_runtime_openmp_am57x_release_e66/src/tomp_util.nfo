These functions may be recursive:
	__gomp_flush0()
	tomp_cacheWbInvAll()
	CACHE_invAllL2()
	CACHE_wbInvAllL1d()
	tomp_allocInitTLSBlock()
	tomp_logError()

Function CACHE_invAllL2() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] wait == 0u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_invAllL2() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned wait :     wait == 0u;

Function CACHE_wbInvAllL1d() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] wait == 0u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void CACHE_wbInvAllL1d() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned wait :     wait == 0u;

Function tomp_logError() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] e == 2u;
	[3] line == 118;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void tomp_logError() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned e :        long double == 2u;
      int line :          line == 118;
