/*      This kernel performs a 3x3 median filter operation on 16-bit        */
/*      signed image pixels. The grey level at each pixel is replaced by    */
/*      the median of nine adjacent values. The median of a set of nine     */
/*      numbers is the middle element so that half of the elements in the   */
/*      list are larger and half are smaller. The input image contains 3    */
/*      adjacent rows from an actual image. The output array will be of     */
/*      size 1 row containing the median values of the middle row of the    */
/*      input. For the first two output's, the two columns outside the      */
/*      image are assumed to be all zeros.                                  */
/*                                                                          */
/*      The first 2 values in the output array will not be containing       */
/*      any meaningful data. The 3rd value in the output array will be      */
/*      the median of 2nd value in the middle row of input array and so on. */
/*      The nth value in the output array will be the median of the (n-1)th */
/*      value in the mid row of input array. Hence the output array will    */
/*      not contain the median values of first and last elements in the     */
/*      middle row of input image. Instead it will contain 2 meaningless    */
/*      values at the beginning of the array.                               */
/*                                                                          */

/*      mask.  The filter data from the previous iteration is "slid         */

/*      resulting in a "lo", "medium" and "hi" pixel value for that         */
