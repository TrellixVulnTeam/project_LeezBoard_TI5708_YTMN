/*      The convolution kernel accepts seven rows of 'pitch' input pixels   */
/*      and produces one row of 'width' output pixels using the input       */
/*      mask of 7 by 7. This convolution performs a point by point mult-    */
/*      iplication of 7 by 7 mask with the input image. The result of 49    */
/*      multiplications are then summed together to produce a 32-bit conv-  */
/*      olution intermediate sum. Overflow while accumulation is not hand-  */
/*      led. However assumptions are made on filter gain to avoid overflow. */
/*      The user defined shift value is used to shift this convolution sum  */
/*      down to the short range and store in an output array. The result    */
/*      being stored is also range limited between -32768 to 32767 and will */
/*      be saturated accordingly. The mask is moved one column at a time,   */
/*      advancing the mask over the entire image until the entire 'width'   */
/*      is covered.The input, output image pixels and the masks are         */
/*      provided as 16-bit signed values.                                   */
