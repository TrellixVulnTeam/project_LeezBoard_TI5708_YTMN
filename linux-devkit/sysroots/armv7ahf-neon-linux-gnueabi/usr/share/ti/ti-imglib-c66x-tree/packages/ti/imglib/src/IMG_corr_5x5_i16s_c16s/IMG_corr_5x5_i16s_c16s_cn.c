/*      of 5x5 mask with the input image. The result of the 25 multiplic-   */
/*      ations are then summed together to produce a 40-bit sum. A rounding */
/*      constant is added and the resulting value is shifted and stored in  */
/*      an array. Overflow and Saturation of the accumulated sum is not     */
/*      handled. However assumptions are made on filter gain to avoid them. */
