Library Architecture and Framework provides an abstraction layer for multi-\/core D\+S\+P library development. It abstracts out from libraries the platform dependent complexities including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Memory management
\item Memory transfers
\item Cache configuration
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Library Architecture and Framework A\+P\+I can be used by library developers as well as library integrators for fast development of portable software, by eliminating the need to deal with platform-\/ or O\+S-\/dependent complexities mentioned above.

This release provides A\+P\+I in three modules, each corresponding to one area of abstracted complexity listed above. Refer to links below for detailed documentation of each module\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{group__libarch__memmgt}{Memory Management A\+P\+I}
\item \hyperlink{group__libarch__cachecfg}{Cache Configuration A\+P\+I}
\item \hyperlink{group__libarch__memtrans}{Memory Transfers A\+P\+I}
